# 💬 Task 4: Basic Chatbot – CodeAlpha Internship

## ✅ Goal:
Build a simple **rule-based chatbot** using Python that interacts with users via console input and responds with predefined replies.

---

## 🧠 Concepts Used:
- `if-elif-else` conditions
- `functions`
- `while` loop for continuous interaction
- `input()` and `print()` for basic user I/O

---

## 💡 Features:
- Accepts input like `"hello"`, `"how are you"`, `"bye"`, etc.
- Responds with predefined answers such as:
  - `"Hi!"`
  - `"I'm fine, thanks!"`
  - `"Goodbye!"`
- Continues until the user types `"bye"` or `"exit"`
- Fully console-based and beginner-friendly

---

## 📁 Files:
- `chatbot.py` — Main Python script

---

## ▶️ How to Run:

1. Open your terminal or IDE (VS Code, PyCharm, etc.)
2. Run the chatbot with:
```bash
python chatbot.py


## 📝 Sample Output:


🤖 ChatBot: Hello! Type something to talk to me. (Type 'bye' to exit)

You: hello
ChatBot: Hi!

You: how are you
ChatBot: I'm fine, thanks! How about you?

You: bye
ChatBot: Goodbye! 👋

##🛠️ How It Works:
Uses a while loop to keep the chatbot running

Uses if-elif-else to match specific user inputs

Exits the loop when user types "bye", "exit", or "quit"
